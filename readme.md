Based on PowerShell 7.0.

### Description
Small GUI for PowerShell 7.0 that assists in running multiple commands on the clients computer.

I just made this quickly to play around with the idea of a GUI to execute commands that were commonly used. Never got any real use for it as it was quicker to remotely connect to the customers PC and execute the required commands.

### Requirements

Requires PowerShell 7.0 to be able to pipe the commands. Can be ran as any regular PowerShell-script:
    `.\SD_GUI_tool.ps1`
